# Unichat Application

![Chat Application](https://link.shutterfly.com/XrzWz1Xgjhb)

## Description

Unichat was created to practice my React.js as well as solidify my ability to
work with API's.

Unichat is a Realtime web based chat application. It utilizes Social Auth (with
Google), dedicated chat APIs/sockets.

The backend is powered by Google's Firebase and the chat functionality stems
from Chat Engine [https://chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io).

During this project I learned: 
- More about React Routing
- How to implement Social Authentication using a Google Account
- How to create a project that utilizes Firebase
- The React Context API
- How to utilize Environment variables

# Future plans:

In a future version I plan to implement e-mail notifications. This will increase
the app's usefulness by enabiling users to chat while offline.

The [Chat Engine docs](https://chatengine.io/docs/email_notifications) contain
more info on how to implement this feature.
